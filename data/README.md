# Data files

This folder contains both raw and intermediate and final files.
Not result graphs, tables etc.
This folder is for CSV, parquet etc.

`raw` contains the raw files that we manually downloaded by hand.
AEMO files (which are larger, and have many intermediate steps) get downloaded by scripts into this folder. (Same with wind data, and DST transition data.) Scripts that merge, process and transform data save their results here.
So basically, everything here is generated by scripts, except `raw`.
Files and folders tend to be numbered the same as the script that produced them.

This folder is ignored by git, because we don't want to add 100GB to our git repo.
But for some non-AEMO raw data, we do want to include it.
So use `git add --force myfile.csv`.
