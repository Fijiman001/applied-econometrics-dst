	abstract = {Previous research on the effects of daylight saving time ({DST}) on electricity consumption has provided mixed results. We use daily state-level panel data on electricity consumption in Australia between 1998 and 2015, during which period there was considerable variation in the presence and timing of {DST} implementation, as well as in weather conditions and cooling usage within and between states. This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the interaction effects of {DST} with exogenous variation in daily weather conditions and cooling usage over two decades. Our results show that the effect of {DST} on electricity consumption depends strongly on weather conditions and cooling usage. Forward {DST} increases the electricity consumption when temperatures and air conditioner ownership are higher. We provide simulations for countries in the European Union that need to decide on {DST} adoption in the coming year. Our ﬁndings are policy-relevant given rising temperatures and worldwide increases in cooling usage during summer.},

In October 2016, Turkey chose to stay on {DST} all year round. Employing alternative identification methods, we find a negligible overall impact on consumption. However, the policy has a strong intra-day distributional effect, increasing consumption in the early morning and reducing it in the late afternoon. This change in the load shape reduced generation by dirtier fossil fuel plants and increased it by cleaner renewable sources that can more easily satisfy peak load generation. Emissions from generation decreased as a result. A large presence of hydropower, which is a reliable provider of energy to the grid in peak times, was crucial to achieve this reduction.},

We estimate the short-run impacts of this reduction on {SO}2, {NOx}, and {CO}2 emissions. Reducing variance decreases emissions in regions where peak demand is met more by oil-fired capacity than by hydropower, such as the Mid-Atlantic. However, reducing variance increases emissions in more U.S. regions, namely those with more hydropower like the West. The effects are relatively small.},

	abstract = {The principal reason for introducing (and extending) daylight saving time ({DST}) was, and still is, projected energy savings, particularly for electric lighting. This paper presents a literature review concerning the effects of {DST} on energy use. Simple estimates suggest a reduction in national electricity use of around 0.5\%, as a result of residential lighting reduction. Several studies have demonstrated effects of this size based on more complex simulations or on measured data. However, there are just as many studies that suggest no effect, and some studies suggest overall energy penalties, particularly if gasoline consumption is accounted for. There is general consensus that {DST} does contribute to an evening reduction in peak demand for electricity, though this may be offset by an increase in the morning. Nevertheless, the basic patterns of energy use, and the energy efﬁciency of buildings and equipment have changed since many of these studies were conducted. Therefore, we recommend that future energy policy decisions regarding changes to {DST} be preceded by highquality research based on detailed analysis of prevailing energy use, and behaviours and systems that affect energy use. This would be timely, given the extension to {DST} underway in North America in 2007.},

We describe a command, eventdd, that allows for simple estimation, inference, and visualization of event study models in a range of circumstances. We then provide several examples to illustrate eventdd’s use and flexibility, as well as its interaction with various native Stata commands, and other relevant community-contributed commands such as reghdfe and boottest.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider identification, estimation, and inference procedures for treatment effect parameters using Difference-in-Differences ({DiD}) with (i) multiple time periods, (ii) variation in treatment timing, and (iii) when the ‘‘parallel trends assumption" holds potentially only after conditioning on observed covariates. We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered {DiD} setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Triple difference has become a widely used estimator in empirical work. A close reading of articles in top economics journals reveals that the use of the estimator to a large extent rests on intuition. The identifying assumptions are neither formally derived nor generally agreed on. We give a complete presentation of the triple difference estimator, and show that even though the estimator can be computed as the difference between two difference-in-differences estimators, it does not require two parallel trend assumptions to have a causal interpretation. The reason is that the difference between two biased difference-in-differences estimators will be unbiased as long as the bias is the same in both estimators. This requires only one parallel trend assumption to hold.},
