	abstract = {We develop a new measure of impact elasticity, defined as a firm’s change in environmental impact due to a change in its cost of capital. We show empirically that a reduction in financing costs for firms that are already green leads to small improvements in impact at best. In contrast, increasing financing costs for brown firms leads to large negative changes in firm impact. Thus, sustainable investing that directs capital away from brown firms and toward green firms may be counterproductive, in that it makes brown firms more brown without making green firms more green. We further show that brown firms face very weak incentives to become more green. Due to a mistaken focus on percentage reductions in emissions, the sustainable investing movement primarily rewards green firms for economically trivial reductions in their already low levels of emissions.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, common electrical household appliances are mostly being powered by means of alternate current ({AC}), although there are cases where direct current ({DC}) is used instead. In all cases, internal devices are supplied with {DC}, and this fact involves there are losses due to the need for {AC}/{DC} converters. At the same time, most electrical home consumption takes place during peak hours when electricity is more expensive in many electricity markets. The addition of a battery in these installations permits storing electrical energy during certain periods of the day with the aim of supplying it during other ones—when this operation is more eﬃcient or convenient—simultaneously reducing costs and greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a comparison is proposed between three possible home consumption scenarios, i.e., one consisting of a current {AC} system, one consisting of an {AC} system with a battery, and a third consisting of a hybrid {AC}/{DC} system with a battery.},

	abstract = {The history of Daylight Saving Time ({DST}) has been long and controversial. Throughout its implementation during World Wars I and {II}, the oil embargo of the 1970s, consistent practice today, and recent extensions, the primary rationale for {DST} has always been to promote energy conservation. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little evidence that {DST} actually saves energy. This paper takes advantage of a natural experiment in the state of Indiana to provide the first empirical estimates of {DST} effects on electricity consumption in the United States since the mid-1970s. Focusing on residential electricity demand, we conduct the first-ever study that uses micro-data on households to estimate an overall {DST} effect. The dataset consists of more than 7 million observations on monthly billing data for the vast majority of households in southern Indiana for three years. Our main finding is that—contrary to the policy's intent—{DST} increases residential electricity demand. Estimates of the overall increase are approximately 1 percent, but we find that the effect is not constant throughout the {DST} period. {DST} causes the greatest increase in electricity consumption in the fall, when estimates range between 2 and 4 percent. These findings are consistent with simulation results that point to a tradeoff between reducing demand for lighting and increasing demand for heating and cooling. We estimate a cost of increased electricity bills to Indiana households of \$9 million per year. We also estimate social costs of increased pollution emissions that range from \$1.7 to \$5.5 million per year. Finally, we argue that the effect is likely to be even stronger in other regions of the United States.},

Males and females, from middle‐ and working‐class backgrounds in three age groups (7/8, 9/10, 11/12), completed a questionnaire which sought to establish such things as the amount of pocket money children received; other sources of income; whether they were required to work for their pocket money; whether and how they were encouraged to save it, etc. The results showed that, whereas there were few sex or class differences, there were a large number of significant age differences. The results are discussed in terms of the children's socialization and experience of money. Limitations of this research and suggestions for further work in this field are noted.},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate the price and income elasticities of adolescent smoking initiation and intensity to determine the extent to which increased pocket money leads to greater smoking among youth, and whether higher taxes can mitigate this effect.
Methods We used the 2012/2013 Canadian Youth Smoking Survey including students in grades 7–12. The multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the probability of smoking initiation, and a linear regression to examine the smoking intensity determined by province-level prices of cigarettes, pocket money, and a vector of individual characteristics, including age, sex, race, and school-related and psychosocial factors.
Results Of respondents, 28.8\% have tried cigarette smoking. More than 90\% of these initiated smoking between age 9 and 17. Male smokers consumed a higher average number of whole cigarettes daily than did females. The price elasticity of smoking initiation and intensity for youth in the full sample were − 1.13 and − 1.02, respectively, which means that a 10\% increase in price leads to an 11.3\% reduction in initiation and a 10.2\% reduction in intensity. The income elasticity of smoking initiation and intensity for youth in the full sample were 0.07 and 0.06, respectively, which means that a 10\% increase in income leads to a 0.7\% increase in initiation and a 0.6\% increase in intensity.
Conclusion Economic measures such as taxation that raise the price of cigarettes may be a useful policy tool to limit smoking initiation and intensity.},

Ang's (2007, 2008) papers are some of the exceptions that simultaneously study the relationship between emissions, growth and energy. With respect to Ang's research, we contribute on two important aspects. First, while Ang uses a particular country as the study and use time series techniques, we take advantage of a panel data set of 24 European countries between 1990 and 2006 and use a Dynamic Panel Data ({DPD}) framework. Second, the impact of energy consumption on emissions would depend on the primary energy mix and on the ﬁnal use of this energy, and we consider both factors in the model.},

In the long-run, energy consumption and economic growth are associated with increase in atmospheric pollution in most countries. Results from the Granger causality tests show evidence of economic growth causing {CO}2 emissions in the short-run in Benin, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal, implying that economic expansion cannot be achieved without affecting the environment. Evidence of reverse causality running from {CO}2 emissions to economic growth has been found for Gabon, Nigeria and Togo, indicating that environmental policies aiming at reducing air pollution may have adverse effects on economic growth. Moreover, bidirectional causality between economic growth and {CO}2 emissions has been found in the shortrun for Nigeria and in the long-run for Congo and Gabon.

We use stated preference data and choice modelling to measure household preferences for battery attributes and functionality. Our survey sample has been sourced from the State of Queensland, Australia, which has some of the highest per capita {PV} installation rates in the world and has many characteristics of an early-adopter market for battery storage. While cost will be a key determinant for mass market uptake, our study found that drivers encouraging self-suﬃciency and grid independence will have a strong inﬂuence on battery system preferences. A majority of the 268 respondents to our survey would prefer to buy medium or large battery systems despite higher costs and longer payback periods. Nearly 70\% of respondents hope to eventually disconnect from the existing centralized electricity supply network. Should these ﬁndings translate more broadly, and battery prices decline as forecast, changing energy market dynamics could result in a range of negative outcomes. Declining infrastructure utilization, asset impairment, rising electricity costs and negative social outcomes could eventuate as consumers attempt to reduce their reliance on existing electricity supply systems. To proactively manage these risks, our study demonstrates the clear need to better understand and address consumer motivations in the impending energy market transition.},

This paper presents a literature review concerning the effects of {DST} on energy use. Simple estimates suggest a reduction in national electricity use of around 0.5\%, as a result of residential lighting reduction. Several studies have demonstrated effects of this size based on more complex simulations or on measured data. However, there are just as many studies that suggest no effect, and some studies suggest overall energy penalties, particularly if gasoline consumption is accounted for. There is general consensus that {DST} does contribute to an evening reduction in peak demand for electricity, though this may be offset by an increase in the morning. Nevertheless, the basic patterns of energy use, and the energy efﬁciency of buildings and equipment have changed since many of these studies were conducted. Therefore, we recommend that future energy policy decisions regarding changes to {DST} be preceded by highquality research based on detailed analysis of prevailing energy use, and behaviours and systems that affect energy use. This would be timely, given the extension to {DST} underway in North America in 2007.},

This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the interaction effects of {DST} with exogenous variation in daily weather conditions and cooling usage over two decades. Our results show that the effect of {DST} on electricity consumption depends strongly on weather conditions and cooling usage.

For each law, we use {OLS} to compute the {DD} estimate of its “effect” as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional {DD} standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an “effect” significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a “pre”- and “post”-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

	abstract = {This article discusses welfare regime change using two theoretical frameworks, i.e. welfare regimes in developing countries and institutional change. Using these theories as a loop to look at the Indonesian case, it suggests that the Indonesian welfare regime has experienced ‘flourishing’ development and changes. The regime has changed three times, stimulated by economic growth, global market pressures and social policy ‘universalization’. The last two changes have been loaded with thorny layering, to which the government introduced numerous government-formal social programmes on top of community-based informal welfare arrangements. This causes complicated consequences, including the problem of informal and formal welfare institutions harming each other. The discussion of the Indonesian case leads to a better understanding of the characteristics and changes of welfare regimes in developing countries, for which there is currently a research gap.},

Our theory highlights that market integration not only improves allocative efficiency by gains from trade but also incentivizes new investment in renewable power plants. To test our theoretical predictions, we examine how recent grid expansions in the Chilean electricity market changed electricity production, wholesale prices, generation costs, and renewable investments. We then build a structural model of power plant entry to quantify the impact of market integration with and without the investment effects. We find that the market integration in Chile increased solar generation by around 180\%, saved generation costs by 8\%, and reduced carbon emissions by 5\%. A substantial amount of renewable entry would not have occurred in the absence of market integration. Our findings suggest that ignoring these investment effects would substantially understate the benefits of market integration and its important role in expanding renewable energy.},

We apply a multi-regional Computable General Equilibrium ({CGE}) model with representation of multiple households according to a family expenditure survey. Important questions for policy makers in Brazil are addressed. What are the economic effects of introducing carbon pricing in Brazil? Is there a double dividend, with economic and environmental benefits, when carbon revenue is recycled through tax rebates? Could carbon revenue contribute to the financing of social spending and to income distribution improvements in Brazil? Results show that carbon pricing avoids further carbon intensive infrastructure lock-in by further promoting biomass in electricity generation and biofuels in the transportation sector. Lump-sum transfers from carbon revenue help boosting income of lower deciles up to +4.5\%, while targeting transfers to most vulnerable groups leads to an income growth of +42.2\% by 2030. Brazil has a large gap in terms of effective carbon pricing when compared to other countries that could be addressed in the context of the ongoing tax reform debate, with carbon revenue contributing to the financing of social spending. Our analysis examines different policy design options and contribute to the debate about fiscal reform and socioeconomic effects of carbon pricing in Brazil.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to evaluate the long-run regional impacts of the tariff policy of the Brazilian electric power sector. This sector has undergone a reform process that started in the 1990s. Since the beginning of the reform, two spatial trends of distribution of electric power tariffs have emerged among the Brazilian states, one of convergence and another of spatial divergence. These trends have been guided by the new electric power tariff policy and by the spatial features of the Brazilian economy, which is marked by a high degree of spatial concentration and hierarchical distribution of large markets. In addition, because of the presence of strong economies of scale, the recent electric power prices differentials might be caused by differentials in market size that provide better conditions for the achievement of economies of scale for electric power utility companies located in larger markets. Given the role of electric power as an important intermediate input in the production process and the interdependence between sectors, an Energy Interregional Computable General Equilibrium model was used to simulate the long-run regional impacts of electric power tariff policy in Brazil. The simulations showed that the heterogeneity of energy-intensity and the differentials of energy substitution drive the spatial impacts of changes in electric power prices. On the other hand, the recent trend of spatial dispersion of electric power prices might contribute to a decrease in the long-run economic growth and to an increase in the regional inequalities in Brazil.},

	abstract = {The 2030 agenda for sustainable development makes it a priority for countries to reduce income inequality while ensuring that people have access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy. Up to date, research examining the impact of energy accessibility on income inequality remain scarce. To contribute to knowledge and policy, this study utilizes a comprehensive dataset for 166 countries to investigate the impact of energy accessibility on income inequality for the period 1990–2017. Utilizing a two-stage generalized-method of moment ({IV}-{GMM}) approach, the empirical results indicated that access to electricity reduces global income inequality, while access to modern and clean energy increase global income inequality. On spatial accessibility to energy, rural and urban electrification were found to reduce global income inequality; however, the estimated elasticity of urban electrification exceeds rural electrification. The results further revealed that access to electricity, modern and clean energy, as well as rural and urban electrification moderate the impact of economic growth and education to improve global income inequality. The findings also indicated that employment, economic growth, education, gender empowerment, industrialization, and health are some of the potential channels through which access to energy influences global income inequality. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the direct and indirect effect of energy accessibility on income inequality varies between Latin America-Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia \& Pacific, Middle East \& North Africa, and Europe \& Central Asia countries. The findings are robust to alternative econometric estimators and different measures of income inequality. We, therefore, argue that access to energy is a pre-condition for improving global income inequality.},

Building on this literature, we conduct an ex post econometric analysis of the county-level economic development impacts of wind power installations from 2000 through 2008 in a large, wind-rich region in the country. Taking into account factors influencing wind turbine location, we find an aggregate increase in county-level personal income and employment of approximately \$11,000 and 0.5 jobs per megawatt of wind power capacity installed over the sample period of 2000 to 2008. These estimates appear broadly consistent with modeled input–output results, and translate to a median increase in total county personal income and employment of 0.2\% and 0.4\% for counties with installed wind power over the same period.},

However, there is a paucity of empirical research on the impact of access to energy on human development, particularly in energy-poor countries. This study, therefore, examines the effect of access to electricity and clean energy on human development in 79 energy-poor countries from South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Caribbean-Latin America for the period 1990–2018. Using the Lewbel two-stage least squares approach to control for endogeneity, our study reveals that access to both electricity and clean energy improve human development in the aggregated sample. Comparatively, our results also suggest that while access to both electricity and clean energy enhance human development in Caribbean-Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, they worsen human development in South Asia. Generally, our results indicate that economic growth, trade openness, foreign direct investment, urbanisation, access to credit and remittance enhance human development. This study also indicates that employment, industrialisation, economic growth, {ICT}, and gender empowerment are some of the important channels through which energy accessibility influence human development. The comparative effect of access to electricity, clean energy, and the control variables on different facets of human development such as education (human capital) and health (life expectancy, maternal mortality, and under-five mortality) are presented. In this study, we conclude that access to energy is crucial for human development but does not equally benefit all the components of human development.},

Using panel data and the Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag ({PQARDL}) technique, we analyze the short- and long-term impacts of these factors while considering industrialization and institution quality. Our findings indicate that financial development and fiscal policy pose significant obstacles to renewable energy development across all quantile distributions in the long run. However, foreign capital positively contributes to renewable energy development across most quantiles, except the 70th quantile. We also observe a declining trend in Sub-Saharan Africa's share of renewable development due to industrialization and institutional quality in the long term. Furthermore, the interactive roles of fiscal policy and institutional quality hinder renewable advancement in the region over time. These empirical outcomes provide valuable insights on how to attract foreign capital and allocate investments in renewable development. By doing so, we can offer consumers cost-competitive choices and strive towards extending high-value-added facilities within a sustainable environment.},

The government of Guatemala has introduced a plan to increase renewable generation capacity, while an estimated 76\% of Guatemalans are energy poor. In this paper, we evaluate the trade-offs between alleviating energy poverty and achieving renewable energy goals in Guatemala. We present a framework that combines an electricity cost model with a household expenditure survey to assess the effects that a national renewable energy development goal could have on energy poverty through added electricity expenditures. We find that the development of new renewable electricity generation has potential to significantly increase tariffs for residential electricity consumers across the country, whereby 80\% of municipalities could experience more than one-third increase in monthly energy expenditures. More importantly, we find that the distribution of impacts will not be equal everywhere: households in the western, rural part of Guatemala that are already energy stressed will likely experience the greatest cost burdens because natural resource availability is low while overall poverty is already high. In addition, we compare the costs of renewable versus fossil fuel development and find that the least-cost policy in Guatemala includes a mix of both renewable and fossil technologies.},

Identiﬁcation is based on variation in light conditions induced by differences in sunrise and sunset times across space and time. We estimate that darkness causes annual costs of more than £500 million in Great Britain. By setting daylight saving time year-round 8 percent of these costs could be saved. Thus, focusing solely on the short run costs related to the transition itself underestimates the total costs of the current time regime.},

Conventional wisdom claims that {RTP} provides additional environmental benefits. This paper argues that {RTP} will reduce the variance, both within- and across-days, in the quantity of electricity demanded. We estimate the short-run impacts of this reduction on {SO}2, {NOx}, and {CO}2 emissions. Reducing variance decreases emissions in regions where peak demand is met more by oil-fired capacity than by hydropower, such as the Mid-Atlantic. However, reducing variance increases emissions in more U.S. regions, namely those with more hydropower like the West. The effects are relatively small.},

              The original intention of daylight saving time ({DST}) was to save energy required for artificial lighting. This one-hour shift in working hours, however, also impacts the current and future heating and cooling demand of buildings, which is yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, daylight saving time-induced heating and cooling demand of archetype offices across the United States are simulated for 15 cities for different representative concentration pathway ({RCP}) climate trajectories. {DST} reduces cooling more than it increases heating. Maximum savings of up to 5.9\% for cooling and 4.4\% increase in heating were simulated under current climatic conditions, noting that cooling dominates the buildings’ demand during the {DST} period. Climate change increases future cooling demand, but does not significantly affect the combined (heating and cooling) potential of reducing energy demand when {DST} is introduced. However, the relative reduction (i.e. decrease in the percentage of total cooling demand) is smaller when considering climate change. The impact of {DST} on cooling and heating energy demand depends on the geographical location, which determines the amount and temporal pattern of cooling and heating demand. For the considered case studies, introducing {DST} with climate change generally resulted in overall combined savings with a maximum saving of 3\% for Port Angeles, assuming an {RCP} 4.5 scenario. Policies that shift working hours need to be evaluated considering their impact on building energy demand and it is necessary to establish whether saving cooling or saving heating energy demand can achieve higher {CO}

A close reading of articles in top economics journals reveals that the use of the estimator to a large extent rests on intuition. The identifying assumptions are neither formally derived nor generally agreed on. We give a complete presentation of the triple difference estimator, and show that even though the estimator can be computed as the difference between two difference-in-differences estimators, it does not require two parallel trend assumptions to have a causal interpretation. The reason is that the difference between two biased difference-in-differences estimators will be unbiased as long as the bias is the same in both estimators. This requires only one parallel trend assumption to hold.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the procurement and pricing of inertial response using a frequency-constrained unit commitment formulation, which co-optimizes the provision of energy and inertia services while accounting for their complementary properties. The proposed approach builds on a two-step process that allows to differentiate between the units being online for energy purposes and the ones committed additionally solely for inertia provision. Subsequently, three novel pricing and payment schemes that reimburse inertia providers in a transparent and fair manner according to their individual participation are proposed. The analysis considers both synchronous and converter-based generators and provides insights regarding the impact of each pricing scheme on total system cost, as well as on the investment signals for technologies capable of offering affordable inertial response. The results show that all three methods will have a beneﬁcial impact on frequency stability and aid the operator in ensuring system reliability, whereas the policy implications to different inertia providing units will vary between the payment schemes.},

The provision of a certain type of ancillary services such as inertia and Frequency Response ({FR}) is needed at all times, to maintain system frequency within secure limits if the loss of a large power infeed were to occur. In this paper we propose a frequency-secured optimisation framework for the procurement of inertia and {FR} with diverse dynamics, which enables to apply a marginal-pricing scheme for these services. This pricing scheme, deduced from a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Program ({MISOCP}) formulation that represents frequency-security constraints, allows for the first time to appropriately value multi-speed {FR}.},

	abstract = {One of the recognized principal issues brought along by the steadfast migration towards power electronic interfaced energy sources is the loss of rotational inertia. In conventional power systems, the inertia of the synchronous machines plays a crucial role in safeguarding against any drastic variations in frequency by acting as a buffer in the event of large and sudden power generation-demand imbalances. In future power electronic-based power systems, the same role can be played by strategically located virtual inertia devices. However, the question looms large as to how the system operators would procure and pay for these devices. In this article, we propose a market mechanism inspired by the ancillary service markets in power supply. We consider a linear network-reduced power system model along with a robust H2 performance metric penalizing the worst-case primary control effort. With a social welfare maximization problem for the system operator as a benchmark, we construct a market mechanism in which bids are invited from agents providing virtual inertia, who in turn are compensated via a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves payment rule. The resulting mechanism ensures truthful bidding to be the dominant bidding strategy and guarantees non-negative payoffs for the agents. A three-region case study is considered in simulations, and a comparison with a regulatory approach to the same problem is presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract The original intention of daylight saving time ({DST}) was to save energy required for artificial lighting. This one-hour shift in working hours, however, also impacts the current and future heating and cooling demand of buildings, which is yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, daylight saving time-induced heating and cooling demand of archetype offices across the United States are simulated for 15 cities for different representative concentration pathway ({RCP}) climate trajectories. {DST} reduces cooling more than it increases heating. Maximum savings of up to 5.9\% for cooling and 4.4\% increase in heating were simulated under current climatic conditions, noting that cooling dominates the buildings’ demand during the {DST} period. Climate change increases future cooling demand, but does not significantly affect the combined (heating and cooling) potential of reducing energy demand when {DST} is introduced. However, the relative reduction (i.e. decrease in the percentage of total cooling demand) is smaller when considering climate change. The impact of {DST} on cooling and heating energy demand depends on the geographical location, which determines the amount and temporal pattern of cooling and heating demand. For the considered case studies, introducing {DST} with climate change generally resulted in overall combined savings with a maximum saving of 3\% for Port Angeles, assuming an {RCP} 4.5 scenario. Policies that shift working hours need to be evaluated considering their impact on building energy demand and it is necessary to establish whether saving cooling or saving heating energy demand can achieve higher {CO} 2 emission reductions.},

However, the policy has a strong intra-day distributional effect, increasing consumption in the early morning and reducing it in the late afternoon. This change in the load shape reduced generation by dirtier fossil fuel plants and increased it by cleaner renewable sources that can more easily satisfy peak load generation. Emissions from generation decreased as a result. A large presence of hydropower, which is a reliable provider of energy to the grid in peak times, was crucial to achieve this reduction.},

	abstract = {The principal reason for introducing (and extending) daylight saving time ({DST}) was, and still is, projected energy savings, particularly for electric lighting. This paper presents a literature review concerning the effects of {DST} on energy use. Simple estimates suggest a reduction in national electricity use of around 0.5\%, as a result of residential lighting reduction. Several studies have demonstrated effects of this size based on more complex simulations or on measured data. However, there are just as many studies that suggest no effect, and some studies suggest overall energy penalties, particularly if gasoline consumption is accounted for. There is general consensus that {DST} does contribute to an evening reduction in peak demand for electricity, though this may be offset by an increase in the morning. Nevertheless, the basic patterns of energy use, and the energy efﬁciency of buildings and equipment have changed since many of these studies were conducted. Therefore, we recommend that future energy policy decisions regarding changes to {DST} be preceded by highquality research based on detailed analysis of prevailing energy use, and behaviours and systems that affect energy use. This would be timely, given the extension to {DST} underway in North America in 2007.},

This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the interaction effects of {DST} with exogenous variation in daily weather conditions and cooling usage over two decades. Our results show that the effect of {DST} on electricity consumption depends strongly on weather conditions and cooling usage. Forward {DST} increases the electricity consumption when temperatures and air conditioner ownership are higher. We provide simulations for countries in the European Union that need to decide on {DST} adoption in the coming year.

Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times. This paper shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator equals a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period DD estimators in the data. A causal interpretation of two-way fixed effects DD estimates requires both a parallel trends assumption and treatment effects that are constant over time. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.}
