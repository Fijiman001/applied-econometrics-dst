\subsection{Data}
\label{sec:data}

%\ac{AEMO} publish data for the \ac{NEM} publicly on their website (NEMWeb\nocite{nemweb, nemweb_mmsdm}). I(Alex) rewrote this, see below
Energy and carbon data was obtained from \ac{AEMO}\nocite{nemweb, nemweb_mmsdm} for 2009 to 2023. 
The dataset does not include Western Australia nor the Northern Territory due to the structure of the \ac{NEM}.
To calculate the emissions per region over time, we take static emissions intensity (tCO2e/MWh) per generator, and join them with energy output (MW) per generator per 5 minutes. We sum to a region level, downsample to half-hourly data, and adjust for inter-region energy flows\footnote{available only with 30-minute granularity. The calculations are explained in detail in Appendix \ref{sec:interconnector calc}.}.
To obtain per capita values, 
quarterly population data per region was downloaded \parencite{abs_population} and linearly interpolated to a daily level.
Weather data was obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology\nocite{weather_data} and Willy Weather\nocite{willy_weather}. Table \ref{tab:summary stats} presents summary statistics for each of these variables.
