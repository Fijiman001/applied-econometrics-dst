    "This script downloads data files from https://www.nemweb.com.au/REPORTS/ and https://www.nemweb.com.au/Data_Archive/Wholesale_Electricity/MMSDM/ .\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Crawl those pages to find a list of URLs for CSV and .zip files\n",
    "2. Filter that list. e.g. delete large files we don't need\n",
    "3. Download those files. (Suprisingly hard. The server is unreliable. Throttles us, gives corrupt files etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this playbook takes about 1 day to run, and produces about 140GB of data, even though the dataset we care about is only a few hundred MB. This is because AEMO mixes up the data we want with lots of data we don't want. It's quite difficult to map their SQL 'tables' to the original files on their website. For most tables we can guess which source files have the data. But for some (in particular, CO2 emissions intensity per generator) I can't find which particular file has that data. So we download them all, process them, then choose just the ones we want (we choose in the next script, not this playbook).  (Actually, we don't download all. We skip files we definitely know don't have the data we want, e.g. gas market data. But that still leaves a lot we're unsure about.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code may seem more complex than you expected. That's because :\n",
    "\n",
    "* I want to do multiprocessing to speed it up. (Some laptops apparently can't handle multiprocessing. So if `use_multiprocessing=False` then we do a `for` loop instead.)\n",
    "* our downloads get throttled, so we need to sleep and retry\n",
    "* The whole thing takes so long that we want to be able to stop the kernel and restart, without the state ending up broken (e.g. writing the same data 1.5 times to and output file.)\n",
    "* Sometimes you can download 1000 files, and then file 1001 fails. I want to keep processing the remainder, gather up all the success/failures, and then compare them. So there's some try/catch stuff to handle that.\n",
    " \n",
    "When faced with a decision between making this code fast vs understandable, I tried to focus on understandable. (Except for multiprocessing)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this on your laptop, you'll want to change `base_data_dir` to point to a directory with >140GB of space. It does not have to be inside this git repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been given a copy of files already downloaded, you can change `base_data_dir` such that `raw_files_path` points to the directory of already-downloaded files. Then this script will avoid re-downloading those files, and will only download new/missing/corrupt files. If you are marking this script based on whether it 'just runs', grab the hard drive with 140GB of already-downloaded stuff, and point the folder variables at that hard drive, then run. Alternatively, if you want to assess that this code 'just runs', set `max_files_per_page=2` to only download a small subset of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many logs generated while running, to see what's happening. That's in `log_file`. (If this script printed them, it would be overwhelming and hard to scroll.)"
