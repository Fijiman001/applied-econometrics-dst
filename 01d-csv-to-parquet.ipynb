    "We have many CSV files, mostly small ones, for each AEMO 'table' (dataframe). This script merges lots of small CSVs, and creates a one large parquet file (per table). \"Compacting\" into fewer, larger files improves performance later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the advantages of parquet over csv, read [this](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/arrow#advantages-of-parquet).\n",
    "The main benefits are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* performance - e.g. if we only care about 2 out of 20 columns, we skip over 90% of data when reading from disk.\n",
    "* type safety - the file keeps track of what's a float vs datetime etc. So we don't have to tell the code what each datatype is after this script.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use pyarrow here, not Pandas. This is partly for performance reasons. Also because Pandas can't handle empty values for some datatypes.\n",

    "When running, don't forget to change `base_data_dir`.\n"
